# Skill Inventory and Anti-Patterns

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Instructions in Japanese imperative ("〜すること") | Agent interprets as user-to-agent command, not system fact | Rewrite as third-person English fact |
| All details in SKILL.md body | Every token loaded on activation regardless of relevance | Move code examples to `references/` |
| `python3 -c` for commit messages | Shell encoding corrupts Japanese/special chars | `create_file` tool → `python3 script.py` |
| Nested reference chains (A→B→C) | Agent uses `head -100` preview and misses content | Keep all refs one level from SKILL.md |
| `git add -A` before commit | Stages `coverage-*/`, `wnjpn.db`, `.playwright-mcp/` | Explicit `git add <file>` only |
| Duplicate patterns across skills | Maintenance burden, inconsistency | Single source of truth; cross-link |
| `cd /path && git ...` after Sail commands | Silent empty output — git appears to do nothing | Use `bash -c "cd /path && git ..."` |
| `git commit -F /tmp/msg.txt` after Sail | File write succeeds but commit sees no changes | Include both write + commit in one `bash -c` |

| GitHub | `github-issue-workflow` | issue / PR operations |
| Testing | `database-migrations-test-optimization` | Mroonga / slow CI |
| Testing | `test-external-dependency-isolation` | AttachedFile / external service |
| Livewire | `livewire-tenant-context` | tenant() null / #[Lazy] |
| Livewire | `livewire-loading-ui` | wire:loading / x-show / sticky |
| Livewire | `livewire-computed-properties` | #[Computed] 0% / #[Url] |
| Data | `ledger-content-data-structure` | content[n] null / index shift |
| ACL | `permission-model` | 403 / cache stale / Role change |
| Workflow | `workflow-status-machine` | status stuck / latestDiff null |
| Search | `rag-vector-search` | RAG wrong / re-index / CI timeout |
| DevEnv | `sail-dev-workflow` | git silent / CSS stale / test DB |

> `name` must equal the directory name (agentskills.io spec). No subdirectory nesting.
